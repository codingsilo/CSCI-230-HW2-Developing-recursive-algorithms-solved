Collaboration policy: the assignment is to be completed individually. You may use any online
or textbook resources. Be sure to site all resources that you use. You may discuss the
assignment with the instructor or with the TA. You may post general questions to piazza, and
specific questions to the instructors privately on piazza. You may not post code publically.
Let a be a java array of integers. Develop recursive algorithms to compute the following:
a. The maximum element of the array
b. The minimum element of the array
c. The sum of the elements of the array
d. The product of the elements of the array
e. The average of the elements of the array
Create a java class named ArrayProcessing that includes the coded methods above. Include
a main method to display the contents of a, followed by the results of each of the methods
a-e in the order shown, with appropriate labels. Ex. “The sum of the element in a is ???”
Due: Wednesday, July 22, 4pm. Bring copy of program with output to turn in at the start of
class.
